scLinguist documentation
===============================

``scLinguist`` a transformer-based framework for RNA-to-protein prediction that follows a two-step training strategy. First, we pretrain modality-specific models on large-scale single-omics datasets using self-supervised learning to extract informative representations. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on paired RNA-protein data, enabling accurate cross-modality translation. This training paradigm allows our model to leverage abundant single-omics data while effectively learning modality relationships from limited paired datasets.
